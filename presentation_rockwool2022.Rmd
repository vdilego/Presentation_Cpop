Let $m_{a}>0$ be the COVID fatality rate for the age group $a$ and $\beta_{a}\in(0,1)$ the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing deaths among the infected]]

Then, the fatality rate of the unvaccinated can be defined as $m_a$, while the fatality rate of the vaccinated becomes $m_a(1-\beta_a)$ (by definition smaller than $m_a$).

---

class: inverse, center, middle, remark-slide-content

Since the total number of deaths is given by the total number of infected times the associated fatality rate, we can rewrite $\text{CFR}_{t,a}$ as:

.content-box-blue[
$$\text{CFR}_{t,a}=\frac{\color{red}{m_{a}}\mathcal{I}^{U}_{t,a}+\color{red}{m_{a}}(1-\beta_{a})\mathcal{I}^{V}_{t,a}}{d^{U}_{t,a}\mathcal{I}^{U}_{t,a}+d^{V}_{t,a}\mathcal{I}^{V}_{t,a}}$$
]

--

.content-box-red[
Taking $\color{red}{m_a}$ as common factor and multiplying and dividing by $d^{U}_{t,a}$ gives:

$$\text{CFR}_{t,a}=\frac{m_{a}}{d^{U}_{t,a}}\frac{d^{U}_{t,a}\mathcal{I}^{U}_{t,a}+(1-\beta_{a})d^{U}_{t,a}\mathcal{I}^{V}_{t,a}}{d^{U}_{t,a}\mathcal{I}^{U}_{t,a}+d^{V}_{t,a}\mathcal{I}^{V}_{t,a}}$$
]


---

class: inverse, center, middle, remark-slide-content

If we call $\color{red}{\gamma_{t,a}}={d^{V}_{t,a}\mathcal{I}^{V}_{t,a}}/({d^{U}_{t,a}\mathcal{I}^{U}_{t,a}+d^{V}_{t,a}\mathcal{I}^{V}_{t,a}})$ the ratio between cases among the vaccinated and the total number of ever infected and detected cases, The case fatality rate can be rewritten as:

.content-box-blue[
$$\text{CFR}_{t,a}=\frac{m_{a}}{d^{U}_{t,a}}\left((1-\color{red}{\gamma_{t,a}})+(1-\beta_{a})\frac{d^{U}_{t,a}}{d^{V}_{t,a}}\color{red}{\gamma_{t,a}}\right)$$ 

]

--

The value of $\color{red}{\gamma_{t,a}}\in[0,1)$ will increase the higher is the number of cases among vaccinated individuals.

class: inverse, center, middle, remark-slide-content

Denoting $Z_{t,a}={d^V_{t,a}}/{d^{U}_{t,a}}$ as the proportion of detected cases among the ever infected after being vaccinated and the proportion detected among the ever infected and unvaccinated and substituting in the previous equation yields

.content-box-blue[

$$\text{CFR}_{t,a}=\frac{m_{a}}{d^{U}_{t,a}}\left((1-\gamma_{t,a})+\frac{1-\beta_{a}}{Z_{t,a}}\gamma_{t,a}\right)$$
]

or, alternatively:

--

.content-box-red[

$$\text{CFR}_{t,a}=\text{CFR}^{U}_{t,a}(1-\gamma_{t,a})+\underbrace{\text{CFR}^{U}_{t,a}\frac{1-\beta_{a}}{Z_{t,a}}}_\color{red}{\text{CFR}^{V}_{t,a}}\gamma_{t,a}$$

]


####This equation shows that the observed $\text{CFR}_{t,a}$ is the weighted sum of the CFR of the unvaccinated $\text{CFR}^{U}_{t,a}={m_{a}}/{d^{U}_{t,a}}$ and the CFR of the vaccinated $\text{CFR}^{V}_{t,a}=({m_{a}}/{d^{U}_{t,a}})((1-{\beta_{a}})/{Z_{t,a}})={m_{a}(1-\beta_a})/{d^{V}_{t,a}}$

# Conclusions


- A constant CFR can **still** mean that vaccines are effective in reducing deaths


- Detecting infections among both the vaccinated and unvaccinated population is key 

- Unless vaccinated people are **also** tested, it is hard to use the CFR as an indicator for monitoring the pandemic

- However - CFR still useful measure for policy makers - how to improve/alternative measures

- Excess mortality also has its issues - maybe "temporary aging"?
